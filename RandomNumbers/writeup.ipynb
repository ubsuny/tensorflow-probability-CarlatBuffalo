    "We wanna simulate random walkers in 1, 2 and 3-d. One crucial step is to replace `numpy.random.choice` by some algorithms in tensorflow. I use `tf.random.uniform` to generate a set of random numbers within a given range. Then we could just use the comsum to sum them up to get the displacement and be able to see their \"moves\".\n",

    "For $\\sigma^2$ and $\\left< {|\\overrightarrow{r_n}|}^2 \\right>$, the details are in the notebook. One important thing is resulted from the step options we have, $\\left< {|\\overrightarrow{r_n}|}^2 \\right>$ has different relations with the step n.  \n",

    "One thing I found that is really good of tensorflow probability is that the docstring is very helpful, particularly for this problem. So we first implement the `tensorflow_probability.distribution.Mixture` to mix two distributions functions, then use mcmc method in tf to simulate walkers and and the binning.  \n",
